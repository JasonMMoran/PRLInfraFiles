Sets an optional extension to the delay before locally cached profiles are deleted at logoff. A value of 0 deletes the profiles immediately during logoff processing. Checks take place every minute, so a value of 60 ensures that profiles are deleted between one and two minutes after users have logged off (depending on when the last check took place). Extending the delay is useful if you know that a process keeps files or the user registry hive open during logoff. With large profiles, this can also speed up logoff.\n\nIf this policy is not configured here, the value from the .ini file is used.\n\nIf this policy is not configured here or in the .ini file, profiles are deleted immediately."

ApplicationProfilesAutoMigration="Automatic migration of existing application profiles"
ApplicationProfilesAutoMigration_Help="Applies to: file-based profile solution only\n\nThis setting enables or disables the automatic migration of existing application profiles across different operating systems. The application profiles include both the application data in the AppData folder and the registry entries under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE. This setting can be useful in cases where you want to migrate your application profiles across different operating systems. \n\nFor example, suppose you upgrade your operating system (OS) from Windows 10 version 1803 to Windows 10 version 1809. If this setting is enabled, Profile Management automatically migrates the existing application settings to Windows 10 version 1809 the first time each user logs on. As a result, the application data in the AppData folder and the registry entries under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE are migrated.\n\nIf there are multiple existing application profiles, Profile Management performs the migration in the following order of priority:\n1. Migrates profiles of the same OS type (Desktop OS to Desktop OS and Server OS to Server OS).\n2. Migrates profiles of the same Windows OS family; for example, Windows 8 to Windows 8.1, or Windows 10 version 1803 to Windows 10 version 1809.\n3. Migrates profiles of an earlier version of the OS; for example, Windows 7 to Windows 10, or Windows Server 2012 to Windows Server 2016.\n4. Migrates from the profiles of the closest OS.\n\nNote:You must specify the short name of the operating system by including the variable "!CTX_OSNAME!" in the user store path so that Profile Management can locate the existing application profiles.\n\nIf this setting is not configured here, the setting from the .ini file is used.\nIf this setting is not configured here or in the .ini file, it is disabled by default."

MigrateWindowsProfilesToUserStore="Migration of existing profiles"
MigrateWindowsProfilesToUserStore_Help="Applies to: file-based profile solution only\n\nProfile management can migrate existing profiles "on the fly" during logon if the user has no profile in the user store.\n\nThe following event takes place during logon: if an existing Windows profile is found and the user does not yet have a Citrix user profile in the user store, the Windows profile is migrated (copied) to the user store on the fly. After this process, the user store profile is used by Profile management in the current and any other session configured with the path to the same user store.\n\nIf this setting is enabled, profile migration can be activated for roaming and local profiles (the default), roaming profiles only, local profiles only, or profile migration can be disabled altogether.\n\nIf profile migration is disabled and no Citrix user profile exists in the user store, the existing Windows mechanism for creating new profiles is used as in a setup without Profile management.\n\nIf this setting is not configured here, the value from the .ini file is used.\n\nIf this setting is not configured here or in the .ini file, all types of existing profiles are migrated."

TemplateProfile="Template profile"
TemplateProfile_Help="Applies to: both file-based and container-based profile solutions\n\nBy default, new user profiles are created from the default user profile on the computer where a user first logs on. Profile management can alternatively use a centrally stored template when creating new user profiles. Template profiles are identical to normal profiles in that they reside in any file share on the network. Use UNC notation to specifying paths to templates. Users need read access to a template profile.\n\nIf this setting is disabled, templates are not used.\n\nIf this setting is enabled, Profile management uses the template instead of the local default profile when creating new user profiles.\n\nIf a user has no Citrix user profile, but a local Windows user profile exists, by default the local profile is used (and migrated to the user store, if this is not disabled). This can be changed by enabling the setting "Template profile overrides local profile".\n\nIf this setting is not configured here, the value from the .ini file is used.\n\nIf this setting is not configured here or in the .ini file, no template is used."

The extra cookies left in the file system after sustained browsing can lead to profile bloat. Enable this setting to force processing of index.dat and remove the extra cookies. The setting might slightly increase logoff time.

DisableDynamicConfig_Help="Applies to: both file-based and container-based profile solutions\n\nProfile management 5.x examines its environment and configures itself accordingly. To disable this for troubleshooting or to retain the settings you used in an earlier version, enable this setting.\n\nIf this setting is not configured here, the value from the .ini file is used.\n\nIf this setting is not configured here or in the .ini file, automatic configuration is turned on so Profile management settings might change if the environment changes."

LogoffRatherThanTempProfile="Log off user if a problem is encountered"
LogoffRatherThanTempProfile_Help="Applies to: both file-based and container-based profile solutions\n\nIf a problem is encountered when the user logs on (for example, if the user store is unavailable) a temporary profile is provided.\n\nAlternatively, enabling this setting displays an error message and logs the user off.\n\nIf this setting is not configured here, the value from the .ini file is used.\n\nIf this setting is not configured here or in the .ini file, a temporary profile is provided."

LastKnownGoodRegistry="NTUSER.DAT backup"

CEIPEnabled="Customer Experience Improvement Program"
CEIPEnabled_Help="Applies to: both file-based and container-based profile solutions\n\nBy default, the Customer Experience Improvement Program is enabled to help improve the quality and performance of Citrix products by sending anonymous statistics and usage information.\n\nIf this setting is not configured here, the value from the .ini file is used.\n\n"


UserGroupLevelConfigEnabled="Enable user-level policy settings"
UserGroupLevelConfigEnabled_Help="Applies to: both file-based and container-based profile solutions\n\nBy default, Profile Management policies work at a machine level. With this policy enabled, Profile Management policies can work at a user level - it can be for an individual user or a user group.\n\nWhen a session starts, Profile Management determines the policy settings to apply by prioritizing user settings over user group settings, and user group settings over machine settings.\n\nIf this setting is not configured here, the value from the .ini file is used.\n\nIf this setting is configured neither here nor in the .ini file, it is disabled.\n\n"

OrderedGroups_Help="Applies to: both file-based and container-based profile solutions\n\nSpecify the priority order for user groups. The order determines which group takes precedence when a user belongs to multiple groups with different policy settings. In the Priority order for user groups field, enter the Security Identifiers (SIDs) or domain names of the groups in descending order of priority, separated by semicolons (;).\n\nExample:\nctxxa.local\groupb;S-1-5-21-674278408-26188528-2146851469-1174;ctxxa.local\groupc;\n\nWhen a user belongs to multiple groups with different policy settings, consider the following:\n\n - If the user belongs to one or more groups defined in this policy, the group with the highest priority takes precedence. \n\n - If the user doesn't belong to any of the groups defined in this policy, the group with the SID listed earliest in alphabetical order takes precedence. \n\nIf this setting is not configured here, the value from the .ini file is used.\n\nIf this setting is configured neither here nor in the .ini file, no priority order is specified."


OutlookSearchRoamingEnabled="Enable search index roaming for Outlook"
OutlookSearchRoamingEnabled_Help="Applies to: both file-based and container-based profile solutions\n\nAllow user-based Outlook search experience by automatically roaming Outlook search data along with user profile. This requires extra spaces in the user store to store search index for Outlook.\n\n You must log off and then log on again for this policy to take effect."

OutlookEdbBackupEnabled="Outlook search index database - backup and restore"
OutlookEdbBackupEnabled_Help="Applies to: both file-based and container-based profile solutions\n\nThis setting configures what Profile Management does during logon when search index roaming for Outlook is enabled.\n\nIf this setting is enabled, Profile Management saves a backup of the search index database each time the database is mounted successfully on logon. Profile Management treats the backup as the good copy of the search index database. When an attempt to mount the search index database fails because the database becomes corrupted, Profile Management automatically reverts the search index database to the last known good copy.\n\nNote: Profile Management deletes the previously saved backup after a new backup is saved successfully. The backup consumes the available storage space of the VHDX files."

OutlookSearchRoamingConcurrentSession="Enable concurrent session support for Outlook search data roaming"
OutlookSearchRoamingConcurrentSession_Part="Maximum number of VHDX disks for storing Outlook OST files"
OutlookSearchRoamingConcurrentSession_Part_gpfx="Maximum number of VHDX disks for storing Outlook OST files"
OutlookSearchRoamingConcurrentSession_Help="Applies to: both file-based and container-based profile solutions\n\nProvides native Outlook search experience in concurrent sessions. Use this policy with the Search index roaming for Outlook policy.\n\nWith this policy enabled, each concurrent session uses a separate Outlook OST file.\n\nBy default, only two VHDX disks can be used to store Outlook OST files (one file per disk). If more sessions start, their Outlook OST files are stored in the local user profiles. You can specify the maximum number of VHDX disks for storing Outlook OST files.\n\nExample:\nYou set the number to 3. As a result, Profile Management stores Outlook OST files on the VHDX disks for the first, second, and third concurrent sessions. It stores the OST file for the fourth concurrent session in the local profile instead."

FSLogixProfileContainerSupport="Enable multi-session write-back for profile containers"
FSLogixProfileContainerSupport_Help="Applies to: both file-based and container-based profile solutions\n\nEnables write-back for profile containers in multi-session scenarios. If enabled, changes in all sessions are written back to profile containers. Otherwise, only changes in the first session are saved because only the first session is in read/write mode in profile containers. Citrix Profile Management profile containers are supported starting with Citrix Profile Management 2103. FSLogix Profile Container is supported starting with Citrix Profile Management 2003.\n\nTo use this policy for FSLogix Profile Container, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:\n1.The FSLogix Profile Container feature is installed and enabled.\n2.Profile type is set to "Try for read-write profile and fallback to read-only" in FSLogix."

MultiSiteReplication="Replicate user stores"
MultiSiteReplication_Part="Paths to replicate a user store"
MultiSiteReplication_Part_gpfx="Replicate user stores - Paths to replicate a user store"
MultiSiteReplication_Help="Applies to: both file-based and container-based profile solutions\n\nLets you replicate a user store to multiple paths in addition to the path that the Path to user store policy specifies, on each logon and logoff. To synchronize to the user store files and folders modified during a session, enable active write back.\n\n Starting with Profile Management version 2209, this feature is available for the full profile container. You can replicate the container to multiple paths. Replicated containers provide profile redundancy for user logon but not for in-session failover.\n\n Note: Enabling the policy can increase system I/O and might prolong logoffs. \n\nFor Profile Management version 2112 or later, you can separate VHDX files from the replicated user store and store them to different paths. To do so, add the path for VHDX files after the path to the replicated user store, and separate the two paths with a vertical bar (|). \nExample: \\path_a|\\path_b indicates that the user store (with VHDX files excluded) is stored in \\path_a and VHDX files are stored in \\path_b."

CredBasedAccessEnabled="Enable credential-based access to user stores"
CredBasedAccessEnabled_Help="Applies to: both file-based and container-based profile solutions\n\nBy default, Profile Management impersonates the current user to access user stores. Therefore, it requires the current user to have permission to directly access the user stores. Enable this feature if you do not want Profile Management to impersonate the current user when accessing user stores. You can put user stores in storage repositories (for example, Azure Files) that the current user has no permission to access.\n\nTo ensure that Profile Management can access user stores, save the profile storage server's credentials in Workspace Environment Management or Windows Credential Manager. We recommend that you use Workspace Environment Management to eliminate the need to configure the same credentials for each machine where Profile Management runs. If you use Windows Credential Manager, use the Local System account to securely save the credentials. \n\nNote: Starting with Profile Management version 2212, this feature is available for both file-based and VHDX-based Profile Management solutions.
