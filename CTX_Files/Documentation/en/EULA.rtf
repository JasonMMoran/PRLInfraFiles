3.\tab DESCRIPTION OF OTHER RIGHTS, LIMITATIONS, AND OBLIGATIONS. Except as expressly set forth in Section 13, you may not transfer, rent, timeshare, grant rights in or lease the PRODUCT except to the extent such foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable mandatory law. Any attempt to do so in violation of this prohibition shall be void. If you purchased or otherwise received replacement License Keys as part of a PRODUCT upgrade or trade-up, or a new product release with new product licenses under MAINTENANCE, you agree to destroy the original License Keys and retain no copies after installation of the new License Keys and PRODUCT. Solely for the purpose of migrating users, you are permitted a ninety (90) day grace period to run both your new and old License Keys in production.

In the event you make a transfer of the PRODUCT in the EU or EER, to the extent permitted by law and notwithstanding the terms of this AGREEMENT, you must uninstall the PRODUCT and License Keys, cease your use, transfer them to the transferee and retain no copies. You are responsible for ensuring that the transferee accepts the terms of this AGREEMENT. You must provide evidence that the conditions for a lawful transfer of the PRODUCT are met.

With respect to your purchase of a product trade-up or upgrade, or your implementation of a product release with new product licenses under MAINTENANCE, you are permitted a 90-day grace period to run both your new and the old PRODUCT licenses in production. This period runs from your purchase of the trade-up or upgrade, and from your download of the new release under your MAINTENANCE program. You agree to destroy the old licenses and retain no copies after the grace period. Certain PRODUCTS include a license overdraft feature that enables you to use a limited number of additional licenses to prevent access denial. Any overdraft feature is offered as a convenience, not as a license entitlement. Any overdraft licenses used must be purchased within thirty (30) days of first use. Note that a PRODUCT may be provided with identified experimental features which are not part of the PRODUCT and which are not covered by MAINTENANCE and the Limited Warranty.
